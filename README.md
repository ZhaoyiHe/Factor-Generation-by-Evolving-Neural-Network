# Factor-Generation-by-Evolving-Neural-Network

This project is to show a typical progress to perform factor combination by Evolving Neural Network. 
1. For each set of factors, initialize a NN, deciding it's specific initial nodes numbers according to number of original factorsï¼Œnumber of hidden nodes to add into the generations. 
2. Select the best NN on each generation according to the fitness score calculated by calculating Rank ic on a rolling window. 
3. Move on with the winners on each generation, decide the number of generations to comb the factors. 
4. Use the output of the final evolved NN.
